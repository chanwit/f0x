# The f0x project
Running Flux effortlessly outside Kubernetes

## Implementation

F0x runs GitOps Toolkit components in Docker containers without requiring a Kubernetes cluster. F0x uses only the API and `etcd` servers to help GOTK components talk to each others.

## Use cases

F0x could be applied for:

  - Edge-computing use cases
  - Standalone GitOps applications
  - etc.
